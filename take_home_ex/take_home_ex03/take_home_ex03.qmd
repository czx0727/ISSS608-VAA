# 1 Overview

From [NCCS](https://www.nccs.gov.sg/singapores-climate-action/impact-of-climate-change-in-singapore/), Singapore is vulnerable to the effects of climate change, evident in the rise in annual mean temperature from 26.9°C to 28.0°C between 1980 and 2020. Additionally, the mean sea level in the Straits of Singapore escalated by 1.2mm to 1.7mm annually from 1975 to 2009.

In recent years, rainfall intensity has heightened, with the annual rainfall total for Singapore experiencing an average increase of 67 mm per decade from 1980 to 2019.
