# 1 Overview

In this take-home exercise, I will continue my visual analytics journey by selecting one of my classmate [Take-Home Exercise 1](https://isss608-xulin.netlify.app/take%20home%20exercise%201/take%20home%20exercise%201.html) and critic the submission in terms of **clarity** and **aesthetics.**

# 2 Data Preparation and installing packages

I will follow the steps in which my classmate did.

I will use the following package:

1.  haven: Import and Export 'SPSS', 'Stata' and 'SAS' Files
2.  ggrepel: an R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels.
3.  ggthemes: an R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for 'ggplot2'.
4.  hrbrthemes: an R package provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.
5.  patchwork: an R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggrepel, patchwork, 
               ggthemes, hrbrthemes,
               tidyverse, haven,cowplot) 
```

Please refer this link [here](https://czx-isss608.netlify.app/take_home_ex/take_home_ex01/take_home_ex01#data-preparation) on how the data source is obtained ðŸ˜Š

```{r}
stu_qqq_SG <- read_rds("data/stu_qqq_SG.rds")
```

# 3 Data Wrangling

```{r}
stu_qqq_SG_MRS <- stu_qqq_SG %>%
  mutate(AVEMATH = (PV1MATH + PV2MATH + PV3MATH + PV4MATH + PV5MATH + PV6MATH + PV7MATH + PV8MATH + PV9MATH + PV10MATH ) / 10,
         AVEREAD = (PV1READ + PV2READ + PV3READ + PV4READ + PV5READ + PV6READ + PV7READ + PV8READ + PV9READ + PV10READ )/ 10,
         AVESCI = (PV1SCIE + PV2SCIE + PV3SCIE + PV4SCIE + PV5SCIE + PV6SCIE + PV7SCIE + PV8SCIE + PV9SCIE + PV10SCIE )/ 10)
```

# 4 **Critique 1**

## 4.1 Original Design

The original design is shown below:

![](images/1.PNG)

Histogram serves the purpose of displaying the distribution of the count of students in each subject.

## 4.2 Clarity

### **4.2.1 Graph Title**

Interesting insight from the graph can be put as a main title. The graph title can be interesting to grab the attention of readers.

### 4.2.2 Axes Labelling

Axes labels must be meaningful to ensure readers are aware of what the axes represents. Names such as **count** is vague and can be improved to be more specific.

### 4.2.3 Adding of Mean

Mean or Median can be included to provide audience with a better interpretation of the distribution among the subjects. This can also be compared among the different subjects.

## 4.3 Aesthetics

### 4.3.1 Colour

Histogram can be of different colour as compared to the background. Grey Background can be improved to give a more clean and professional look.

### 4.3.2 Title and Axes Label

In addition, the orientation of the histograms can be changed to ensure the title is readable. The rotation of y-axis label should be changed to ensure readability as well. Spelling of the y and x axis label can be adjusted accordingly to a give a more formal formatting (e.g. first letter of each word is capitalised while the rest is not)

# 5 Critique 2

## 5.1 Original Design

The original design is shown below:

![](images/2.PNG)

The above is a boxplot to show the comparison between the various subjects among female and male.

## 5.2 Clarity

### **5.1.1 Graph Title**

Interesting insight from the graph can be put as a main title. The graph title should be interesting to grab the attention of readers. In addition, putting **F** and **M** may be misleading to the readers

### 5.2.1 Axes Labelling

Axes labels must be meaningful to ensure readers are aware of what the axes represents. Names such as **AVEMATH** and **Factor()** can be misleading and can be improved to be more specific.

## 5.3 Aesthetics

### 5.3.1 Colour

Grey Background can be improved to give a more clean and professional look.

### 5.3.2 Title and Axes Label

In addition, the boxplots can be combined and also the title can be improved to be more readable. The rotation of y-axis label should be changed to ensure readability as well. Spelling of the y and x axis label can be adjusted accordingly to a give a more formal formatting (e.g. first letter of each word is capitalised while the rest is not). If legends are used, it should be labelled clearly.

# 6 Learning Points

Take Home Exercise 2 has enabled me to improve my peer's Take Home Exercise 1. In addition, it serves as an opportunity to improve my own work (if time permits). I understand the need to have an appropriate visualisation to communicate a "story" to the potential audience. It is not just plotting a boxplot/histogram. The design, colours and words used should convey a theme and message. This exercise also has enabled me to spend time in understanding theÂ **ggplot (grammar of graphics)**.

From a work perspective, I should be mindful in giving critique to colleagues in terms of their work. We would need acknowledge the effort done and provide the information as a form of improvement. We should not let down on fellow colleagues' hard work.
